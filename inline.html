It is located right in the middle of the Carpathian mountains. The highest Ukrainian mountain, Hoverla (2,061m), will be in close proximity.</div>

Since ancient times, Ukrainians have created various patterns, techniques, and methods of dyeing threads. This knowledge was passed on to the next generations, that is why the embroidery varies depending on the region, and even different villages have their special and unique patterns, styles, and colours of Ukrainian traditional clothing. The most common ornaments are geometrical, which have a sacral meaning, and floral.</div>
